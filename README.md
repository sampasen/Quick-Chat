# Connectify

Quick chat is a real-time chat application developed using Node.js and Socket.IO. It enables users connected to the same 
server to exchange messages instantly through a clean and intuitive web interface.
Built on top of WebSocket technology using Socket.IO, Quick Chat ensures fast and seamless communication between 
users. Messages are transmitted and displayed in real time, creating a smooth chatting experience without the need for 
page reloads. Users can simply enter their message into the chat input box and press Enter to send. All connected 
participants will see the message immediately, making Quick chat ideal for real-time group conversations or
lightweight chat scenarios.



## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use Quick Chat to chat with other users who are also connected to the same server. Simply type your message into the chat box and press enter to send it.
